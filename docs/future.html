    <h2>Future Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        FrontPage is a web application that provides a centralized location for users to access trending news.
        The application also supports searching for specific topics across a wide variety of social media platforms
        and news outlets and condenses the results based on popularity. As there is not currently one application that offers trending news from both
        social media sites and new sources in such a simplified format, FrontPage aims to become a centralized platform for
        users to access top news stories with ease, without having to visit and scroll through multiple websites and
        applications to access the most popular posts.
    </p>
    <h2>Future Scope and Applications</h2>
    <p>
        Since sixty-seven percent of adults get their news from social media, and over one quarter of this demographic gets news from one site only, our applications aims to offer a unique experience that allows users to track top news stories from a centralized location (Pew Research Center). Our mission addresses “reinventing news” and the way that consumers track trending stories.
FrontPage will pull data from both news networks and social media sites in order to provide the most integrated, content-rich experience.
